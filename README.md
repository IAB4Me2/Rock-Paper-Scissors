# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is my first attempt at making a game in javascript. I had worked on this for a while, and had started over a few times. Each time I had tried to streamline it a bit more, I am slightly familliar with loops, but Odin_Project said it will be covered in the next segment, so I just initiated the function 4 more times to complete the task.

A new to me concept is the math.floor deal to provide a random string, spent alot of time on that, math to manipulate strings?! needs more lookin into.
